We believe in the power of strictly separating the process of designing from coming up with content. That's why we've developed a next generation software suite catered to diverse digital marketing needs. The rise of online marketing channels as vital means of customer engagement has increased the demand for visually appealing content from businesses. This, combined with the consumers expectation of personalized experiences, has led to a surge in the need for professional digital media creation across various platforms and channels. With decentralized organizational structures and the rise of remote work the need to involve more and more people in the digital media creation process, companies require streamlined workflows and collaborative tools. Bluepic tackles this demand by offering an innovative workflow that strictly separates the process of designing from coming up with content. Introducing Bluepic Studio, the industry's first comprehensive no-code editor for crafting responsive graphic templates. A professional designer can create templates tailored precisely to the company's brand identity, that later can be easily customized by non-professional users to create the final content. As designers work on the templates, they can leverage an extensive library of input modules, mathematical functions, and logical operations. Imagine Bluepic Studio as a fusion of a graphic design tool and spreadsheet software, with never-before-seen template creation features. These Bluepic templates can be effortlessly shared with all your employees, business partners, or even third parties via the Bluepic Social app. With Bluepic Social graphics become forms! Anyone is now able to fill templates with content from anywhere and on any device, within a minute. The best part? There is no need of design skills or knowledge of the brand-design-guidelines because the design happens automatically and safely in the background.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Design, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Other, Sales and Marketing, Software",4,1-10,"Lukas Wicke, Markus Hiller, Maurice Conrad, Thomas Wicke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Central to Logion's mission is the empowerment of tokens across various blockchains, elevating them to legal-grade digital assets with real-world relevance. In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, a significant gap exists between the on-chain representation of assets (tokens on the blockchain) and their real-world rights and values. Logion addresses this challenge by synergizing advanced blockchain technology with a comprehensive legal framework. This innovative approach ensures that tokens extend beyond mere digital representations, embodying verifiable rights, obligations, and tangible value. At the heart of Logion's infrastructure is the ""Proof of Law"" concept, a unique and pivotal feature that assures the legal enforceability and legitimacy of every token and digital asset on the platform. It signifies a token's tangible value and the rights attached to it, effectively bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. Beyond token-based operations, Logion's versatility shines in its application to non-token processes, particularly in enhancing the security and efficiency of supply chains. By implementing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, Logion certifies data without compromising privacy, under the oversight of a decentralized network of Judicial Officers. This approach guarantees not only technical safety but legal protection, fostering a digital economy that is transparent, trustworthy, and accessible to a broader audience. Logion is more than a blockchain platform; it's a visionary initiative to transform how digital assets are viewed and utilized, bringing unparalleled transparency and legal integrity to the forefront of the digital age.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other",2,11-50,"David Schmitz, Elie Auvray",1,Seed,2022-05-25,100000,USD,100000,Pre-Seed,100000,USD,100000,Pre-Seed,100000,USD,100000,100000,USD,100000,"Outlier Ventures, Primal Capital, WING by Digital Wallonia",,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis of the 3D-printer is an innovative belt technology, which broadens the horizons of user’s creative work via full automation and a continuous printing process.  In a few months, iFactory3D successfully secured partnerships with key business stakeholders: the team of high qualified engineers working on improvements of the printer and key suppliers. Additionally, the Company applied for several accelerator programs and received positive feedback from promising investors. Moreover, the Company contacted more than 1000 3D-printing enthusiasts and got positive feedback about the price and quality of the printer. The focus lies on the B2C segment, which suffers from the absence of ready-to-buy solutions of such a type of a belt printer. As for today only a few prototypes were created and a few quite expensive B2B solutions are available on the market. The company with its headquarter in Germany has access to one of the largest and one of the most payable B2C markets.
