After years of design, feedback from friends, architects and construction companies, we succeeded in the successful market launch of revvis in July 2017. The idea After one of our founding members realized the biggest investment of his life - the purchase of a prefabricated house - the first uncertainties arose due to the different interpretation of each family member. The practical layout of the rooms, the actual perceived size and also the brightness in the individual rooms were pure speculation. It was followed by a consideration and the answer that got everything rolling: ""Can you already look at the house somewhere as a 3D model? Is there something like that? ""No, we found out. With our approach, we wanted to create sustainability and, in particular, fill the gap between the own imagination and a simple floor plan, bringing people together to simplify things. In the meantime, we have been able to develop many different functionalities in revvis, which makes this simulation software a worthwhile companion before, during and after the construction phase.","Hardware, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, using real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. In terms of automated production and level of digitalization, the construction industry is still significantly behind other industries. Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions. DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling). Tunnelware is a VaaS (Virtuality as a Service) for tunnel construction industry to manage the construction process while managing the data generated by various sensors and human interaction. With a focus on reducing cost and waste​ and increasing productivity, our system will improve the construction process at every stage, delivering faster builds to a higher quality with fewer defects and more sustainable tunnels.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate, Software, Transportation",3,1-10,"Holger Sprengel, Jens Piesk, Rahul Tomar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2

The ichó applications give patients access to guideline-compliant therapy programmes, while the smart patient monitoring transparently displays the therapy process with real-world data. While smartphone apps or tablet solutions are already a challenge for patients to use, ichó has been specially developed for people with cognitive and motor impairments. The smart therapy ball recognises all interactions such as rolling, catching or shaking and reacts with coloured light, sound or music depending on the programme. Together with therapists, there are over 150 guideline-compliant therapy applications that stimulate patients' cognitive and motor skills. The effectiveness of ichó is confirmed by medical professionals and evaluations. Since its market launch in 2020, ichó has already been used in over 850 facilities.
