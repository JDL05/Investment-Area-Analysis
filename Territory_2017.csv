Made by the crowd. Be part of the world’s largest brain! Companies are constantly facing challenges. You have suffered a setback, have a vague feeling for a fascinating opportunity or need fresh and new impulses in a certain situation. In today's dynamic world, it would be presumptuous to believe that the management has an answer to everything. Actually it doesn't have to, because there is foxem.net. foxem.net is an online platform on which small, medium and large companies publish their challenges, problems and questions and receive ideas, solutions and best practices from their own employees and thanks to digitization from a worldwide crowd. foxem.net provides ideas on existing products, processes and services, but also focuses in particular on the megatrends that are already gradually and continuously changing our society today. The 12 megatrends are mobility, urbanization, connectivity, neo-ecology, globalization, gender shift, knowledge culture, health, new work, silver society, security and individualization. foxem.net not only raises the gold in employees' minds with a method inspired by Harvard Business School, but also optionally integrates customers and suppliers, expert networks, universities, research institutes, unconventional thinkers and creative minds into the idea-finding process. Basically, everyone is invited to become part of the largest brain in the world - most important is that he or she is open to sharing his or her knowledge, is interested in challenges and wants to make a contribution. For good ideas, crowd members receive rewards, the best idea is rewarded extraordinarily. Through the diversity of crowd members, the functions of the right and left brain complement each other on foxem.net to form a collective mastermind - logic, analysis and reason versus emotion, musicality and intuition, structure, planning and control versus empathy, creativity and lateral thinking. Companies get higher quality, more diversified and more concrete ideas than with all existing systems and that in a highly efficient and cost-effective way. ProBono campaigns are a special type of challenge that deal with issues that do not concern a particular company but society as a whole. Special features of foxem.net are the very easy implementation and usability, the integration of gamification and artificial intelligence and a high degree of automation. However, the unique selling point is and remains natural intelligence - the diversity and individuality of all people who are part of the world's largest brain.

It was founded in March 2017 in Maastricht, Netherlands. Through its cryptocurrency (DCN) and a set of incentivized software tools, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of DCN. Dentacoin owes its existence to the joint efforts of a group of like-minded dentistry and digital transformation experts eager to reshape the dental industry by adopting integrated, Blockchain-based technologies. The Foundation is backed by a vast community of progressive dentists committed to moving the focus from acute treatment to sustainable prevention in the interest of all people. Dentacoin is the one and only cryptocurrency in the world that connects all participants in the global dental industry. In contrast to the inflation-prone world currencies, it holds the potential to make people richer rather than poorer. In its essence, Dеntacoin has a strong social aspect - it empowers people to receive affordable and sustainable dental care and to earn additional income for their active usage of Dentacoin Apps. The Blockchain-based software tools developed by the Dentacoin Foundation are a means of distributing DCN cryptocurrency to the key end users (i.e. patients, dentists, manufacturers). In return for writing reviews about their dentist (Trusted Reviews Platform), taking dental surveys (DentaVox), and maintaining excellent oral hygiene (Dentacare Mobile dApp), they receive different amounts of DCN. Thus, people within Dentacoin Ecosystem are encouraged to contribute to the improvement of dental care both on a personal and global level. The next milestone on Dentacoin’s roadmap is the development of another two Blockchain-based applications - a revolutionary insurance-like model called Dentacoin Assurance, with its testnet already released and a secure, patient-managed Health Database.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Health Care, Other",3,11-50,"Dimitar Dimitrakiev, Jeremias Grenzebach, Philipp Grenzebach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It provides advanced tools and services to be used by healthcare professionals. PostDICOM is an advanced software for all users who want secure data archiving and access in the healthcare field, especially healthcare professionals. With this software, both individuals and corporate users will be able to convert any medical image into DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format and store it in the cloud environment. Data is stored in the cloud and provided with high-level data security. It is easily accessible from any HTML5 compliant devices (desktop PCs, tablets and smartphones). Owing to these qualities, it can be used as an individual archive for many years as well as being used as a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) and TeleHealth solution for a hospital chain. If you want to use it as a PACS solution, you will be able to access the data very quickly thanks to advanced image processing tools and data streaming algorithms. Under all conditions, our highest priority is that the end user gets the best service. The system is available with 50 GB of free space. This space is free and expandable. If you need more space, request for an additional data and we will provide you storage space with a fee. The software is mainly used for image archiving, processing and grouping, and in the future it will be used for sharing and training purposes. With these features, it goes beyond just being an archive and ensures that all users behave like an independent enterprise on the system. Healthcare professions will be able to exchange ideas with their colleagues on their own fields, offer their patients a second opinion and safely archive data from patients if necessary. Our company is well aware of the importance and confidentiality of healthcare data. We will take highest level of safety precautions and will not allow even the smallest system vulnerability. It is our greatest desire that our users use this service with great pleasure and enthusiasm. For this purpose, we express that we are open to any suggestions, opinions and requests that you may send us. Our only expectation from our users is that you can not allow the system to be used outside the intended purpose. It is important to notify us about any sharing and approach that will harm this structure. Since the sharing environment of the software will provide the safest transfer of any kind of medical information, it will also eliminate problems related to personality rights and patient privacy. Because the patient information can be anonymized and shared, patient identity will not be known except for the archiving user. Since there are no restrictions or technological limitations associated with accessing the system from mobile devices, it is possible to transfer and display data from any mobile device. Patient and doctor communications will be easy in the case of emergency.","Health Care, Information Technology, Software",,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Before DepotCity the search for suitable warehouse space and fulfillment services was a timely, in transparent and manual task: desk research, phone calls and emails used to be the tools to purchase storage space. In addition, in-depth logistical knowledge was advantageous to compare and rate different service offerings. Additionally, minimum trading units and inflexible contract durations made short term usage of storage solutions nearly impossible.  DepotCity is an easy and comfortable solution to this problem. Through its website www.depotcity.de, after filling out basic information about the required service, an offer is made and can be booked instantly.
