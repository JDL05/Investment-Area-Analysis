It's a SaaS platform that directs and governs scheduling processes for the benefit of a company’s business and productivity. Companies have numerous tools to manage data and processes. But they don't have any tool to manage and prioritise the organisation's time. When which group of participants works together on which topic is controlled exclusively by structural specifications. We are convinced that in a knowledge-driven economy, the use of time to create value must be digitised and automated. Therefor Scedule goes beyond the known scope of scheduling tools: A smart algorithm identifies meaningful date proposals that take into account specific business preferences. Resource bookings in linked groupware are made automatically and in advance according to the schedule. The Scedule API enables the integration of ready-to-use applications into company-specific collaboration tools.

In doing so, we have never lost sight of the customer focus and have incorporated the feedback from numerous pilot projects with long-standing customers into the further development. Only in this way could we be sure that our solutions supported caregivers in their everyday work and relieved them in the long term. And that for many years: because the solutions are designed to be future-proof so that you benefit from regular updates and the highest level of investment protection. Our solution consists of the nevisCura bed and room sensor. The bed sensor from nevisCura is an intelligent bed exit alarm that noticeably facilitates the daily work of caregivers. Once attached to the bed in just a few steps, the silent guard discreetly signals when a resident wants to get out of bed - even before he or she has set foot on the floor. And best of all: the sensor is compatible with every common call system. The room sensor from nevisCura is an innovative sensor system that is used for fall detection and prevention in outpatient and inpatient care facilities.
