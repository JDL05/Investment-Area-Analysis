We believe in the power of strictly separating the process of designing from coming up with content. That's why we've developed a next generation software suite catered to diverse digital marketing needs. The rise of online marketing channels as vital means of customer engagement has increased the demand for visually appealing content from businesses. This, combined with the consumers expectation of personalized experiences, has led to a surge in the need for professional digital media creation across various platforms and channels. With decentralized organizational structures and the rise of remote work the need to involve more and more people in the digital media creation process, companies require streamlined workflows and collaborative tools. Bluepic tackles this demand by offering an innovative workflow that strictly separates the process of designing from coming up with content. Introducing Bluepic Studio, the industry's first comprehensive no-code editor for crafting responsive graphic templates. A professional designer can create templates tailored precisely to the company's brand identity, that later can be easily customized by non-professional users to create the final content. As designers work on the templates, they can leverage an extensive library of input modules, mathematical functions, and logical operations. Imagine Bluepic Studio as a fusion of a graphic design tool and spreadsheet software, with never-before-seen template creation features. These Bluepic templates can be effortlessly shared with all your employees, business partners, or even third parties via the Bluepic Social app. With Bluepic Social graphics become forms! Anyone is now able to fill templates with content from anywhere and on any device, within a minute. The best part? There is no need of design skills or knowledge of the brand-design-guidelines because the design happens automatically and safely in the background.","Apps, Commerce and Shopping, Design, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Other, Sales and Marketing, Software",4.0,1-10,"Lukas Wicke, Markus Hiller, Maurice Conrad, Thomas Wicke",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Central to Logion's mission is the empowerment of tokens across various blockchains, elevating them to legal-grade digital assets with real-world relevance. In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, a significant gap exists between the on-chain representation of assets (tokens on the blockchain) and their real-world rights and values. Logion addresses this challenge by synergizing advanced blockchain technology with a comprehensive legal framework. This innovative approach ensures that tokens extend beyond mere digital representations, embodying verifiable rights, obligations, and tangible value. At the heart of Logion's infrastructure is the ""Proof of Law"" concept, a unique and pivotal feature that assures the legal enforceability and legitimacy of every token and digital asset on the platform. It signifies a token's tangible value and the rights attached to it, effectively bridging the gap between digital and physical realms. Beyond token-based operations, Logion's versatility shines in its application to non-token processes, particularly in enhancing the security and efficiency of supply chains. By implementing Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology, Logion certifies data without compromising privacy, under the oversight of a decentralized network of Judicial Officers. This approach guarantees not only technical safety but legal protection, fostering a digital economy that is transparent, trustworthy, and accessible to a broader audience. Logion is more than a blockchain platform; it's a visionary initiative to transform how digital assets are viewed and utilized, bringing unparalleled transparency and legal integrity to the forefront of the digital age.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Information Technology, Internet Services, Other",2.0,11-50,"David Schmitz, Elie Auvray",1.0,Seed,2022-05-25,100000.0,USD,100000.0,Pre-Seed,100000.0,USD,100000.0,Pre-Seed,100000.0,USD,100000.0,100000.0,USD,100000.0,"Outlier Ventures, Primal Capital, WING by Digital Wallonia",,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

If too many drivers are missing, supply chains cannot be maintained, and the supply chain is interrupted. One of the causes of the driver shortage is poor working conditions. For this reason, we have launched the LKW.APP with aparkado to provide truck drivers with better working conditions by simplifying their daily routine with the help of an innovative app. The LKW.APP includes an intelligent parking guidance system with over 20,000 listed parking spaces including on-site services. A unique feature is the parking space utilization display. The loading ramp guide provides valuable information about the loading ramps of the companies. With the LKW.APP, we want to ensure safe transportation, where drivers can spend relaxing breaks along the highway. The app's features are designed to display helpful information that they can use to optimize their workday. Not only is this convenient, but it also increases safety on the roads, as the app can warn drivers of dangerous conditions and keep them updated on any traffic-related issues. In addition, the trucker app also helps improve working conditions by highlighting grievances and encouraging improvements. Nothing works without truck drivers. We are convinced of this and are committed to improving the professional lives of the drivers.","Software, Transportation",2.0,11-50,"Philipp Henn, Roland Moussavi",2.0,,2025-01-09,,,,Corporate Round,,,,Corporate Round,,,,,,,TIMOCOM,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

The company guarantees its customers a lifelong usufructuary right, which is registered with first priority on the entire property in the land register. In return, the partial seller pays a monthly usage fee. Both partners benefit from the future increase in the value of the property. The team has grown steadily and today comprises over 80 experts with a wealth of experience in real estate (Engel & Voelkers ), financing (Deutsche Bank, LEG), technology (Deutsche Telekom) and marketing (WPP).

After years of design, feedback from friends, architects and construction companies, we succeeded in the successful market launch of revvis in July 2017. The idea After one of our founding members realized the biggest investment of his life - the purchase of a prefabricated house - the first uncertainties arose due to the different interpretation of each family member. The practical layout of the rooms, the actual perceived size and also the brightness in the individual rooms were pure speculation. It was followed by a consideration and the answer that got everything rolling: ""Can you already look at the house somewhere as a 3D model? Is there something like that? ""No, we found out. With our approach, we wanted to create sustainability and, in particular, fill the gap between the own imagination and a simple floor plan, bringing people together to simplify things. In the meantime, we have been able to develop many different functionalities in revvis, which makes this simulation software a worthwhile companion before, during and after the construction phase.","Hardware, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system across its lifecycle, using real-time data to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning. In terms of automated production and level of digitalization, the construction industry is still significantly behind other industries. Nevertheless, the megatrends like Big Data or the Internet of Things offer great opportunities for the future development of the construction sector. Prerequisite for the successful Construction 4.0 is the creation of a digital twin of a construction site. CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling) enables architects and planners to come together and work on a set of 3D models. This in return, creates an interactive project which promotes real-time collaboration. When the architects and engineers are collaborating, planning and sharing the information of the project, they are effectively employing CIM. Through the use of CIM, projects of any scale are able to be constructed, this could be something as small as an individual building to a full-fledged town. CIM’s ability to offer improved results at a lower cost is what drives the change from traditional methods in the industry. Along the total life cycle from design to construction, operation and maintenance towards remodeling or demolition, the digital twin follows all modifications of the real construction site and dynamically readjusts itself in case of recorded performance differences. Thus, for the whole lifespan of the real construction site, performance predictions generated with the virtual twin represent an accurate basis for well-informed decisions. DigitalTwin Technology is a construction technology company operating out of Cologne Germany. DigitalTwin Technology is the first company in the world to make use of VR and AR for digital twin in the tunneling segment of the construction industry for CIM (Construction/Civil Information Modeling). Tunnelware is a VaaS (Virtuality as a Service) for tunnel construction industry to manage the construction process while managing the data generated by various sensors and human interaction. With a focus on reducing cost and waste​ and increasing productivity, our system will improve the construction process at every stage, delivering faster builds to a higher quality with fewer defects and more sustainable tunnels.","Artificial Intelligence (AI), Commerce and Shopping, Data and Analytics, Design, Hardware, Information Technology, Media and Entertainment, Real Estate, Software, Transportation",3.0,1-10,"Holger Sprengel, Jens Piesk, Rahul Tomar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,2.0

The therapeutic care of these patients is already a major challenge today. Due to demographic change and a shortage of skilled labour, there is a risk of undersupply. The innovative medical device, the ichó therapy ball, provides patients with a smart device that stimulates and guides them in the implementation of therapeutic measures. The ichó applications give patients access to guideline-compliant therapy programmes, while the smart patient monitoring transparently displays the therapy process with real-world data. While smartphone apps or tablet solutions are already a challenge for patients to use, ichó has been specially developed for people with cognitive and motor impairments. The smart therapy ball recognises all interactions such as rolling, catching or shaking and reacts with coloured light, sound or music depending on the programme. Together with therapists, there are over 150 guideline-compliant therapy applications that stimulate patients' cognitive and motor skills. The effectiveness of ichó is confirmed by medical professionals and evaluations. Since its market launch in 2020, ichó has already been used in over 850 facilities. In mid-2023, based on the evaluations, the ichó therapy programme was funded by the care insurance funds for the first time as a preventive service in accordance with Section 5 SGB XI.

Made by the crowd. Be part of the world’s largest brain! Companies are constantly facing challenges. You have suffered a setback, have a vague feeling for a fascinating opportunity or need fresh and new impulses in a certain situation. In today's dynamic world, it would be presumptuous to believe that the management has an answer to everything. Actually it doesn't have to, because there is foxem.net. foxem.net is an online platform on which small, medium and large companies publish their challenges, problems and questions and receive ideas, solutions and best practices from their own employees and thanks to digitization from a worldwide crowd. foxem.net provides ideas on existing products, processes and services, but also focuses in particular on the megatrends that are already gradually and continuously changing our society today. The 12 megatrends are mobility, urbanization, connectivity, neo-ecology, globalization, gender shift, knowledge culture, health, new work, silver society, security and individualization. foxem.net not only raises the gold in employees' minds with a method inspired by Harvard Business School, but also optionally integrates customers and suppliers, expert networks, universities, research institutes, unconventional thinkers and creative minds into the idea-finding process. Basically, everyone is invited to become part of the largest brain in the world - most important is that he or she is open to sharing his or her knowledge, is interested in challenges and wants to make a contribution. For good ideas, crowd members receive rewards, the best idea is rewarded extraordinarily. Through the diversity of crowd members, the functions of the right and left brain complement each other on foxem.net to form a collective mastermind - logic, analysis and reason versus emotion, musicality and intuition, structure, planning and control versus empathy, creativity and lateral thinking. Companies get higher quality, more diversified and more concrete ideas than with all existing systems and that in a highly efficient and cost-effective way. ProBono campaigns are a special type of challenge that deal with issues that do not concern a particular company but society as a whole. Special features of foxem.net are the very easy implementation and usability, the integration of gamification and artificial intelligence and a high degree of automation. However, the unique selling point is and remains natural intelligence - the diversity and individuality of all people who are part of the world's largest brain.

Anonybox promises a hassle-free delivery by integrating self-fulfilling virtual contractual clauses to act as an insurance for all participating parties. What problem ?

Our goal is to tackle the Last Mile in a decentralized and secure way using a Peer-to-Peertrust-less approach similar to Uber. By merging many upcoming technologies such as the Smart Contracts, the IoT sensors of many mobile devices (Bluetooth, GPS, Internet connectivity, QR-Code processing) and Artificial Intelligence for our Smart Routes and by being a crowdsourced platform, we can offer a complete one-stop solution regarding the problem of the Last Mile in modern logistics.","Administrative Services, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Financial Services, Payments, Software, Transportation",3.0,1-10,"Benjamin Reichardt, Cenk Kuscu, Kadir Bacak",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It was founded in March 2017 in Maastricht, Netherlands. Through its cryptocurrency (DCN) and a set of incentivized software tools, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of DCN. Dentacoin owes its existence to the joint efforts of a group of like-minded dentistry and digital transformation experts eager to reshape the dental industry by adopting integrated, Blockchain-based technologies. The Foundation is backed by a vast community of progressive dentists committed to moving the focus from acute treatment to sustainable prevention in the interest of all people. Dentacoin is the one and only cryptocurrency in the world that connects all participants in the global dental industry. In contrast to the inflation-prone world currencies, it holds the potential to make people richer rather than poorer. In its essence, Dеntacoin has a strong social aspect - it empowers people to receive affordable and sustainable dental care and to earn additional income for their active usage of Dentacoin Apps. The Blockchain-based software tools developed by the Dentacoin Foundation are a means of distributing DCN cryptocurrency to the key end users (i.e. patients, dentists, manufacturers). In return for writing reviews about their dentist (Trusted Reviews Platform), taking dental surveys (DentaVox), and maintaining excellent oral hygiene (Dentacare Mobile dApp), they receive different amounts of DCN. Thus, people within Dentacoin Ecosystem are encouraged to contribute to the improvement of dental care both on a personal and global level. The next milestone on Dentacoin’s roadmap is the development of another two Blockchain-based applications - a revolutionary insurance-like model called Dentacoin Assurance, with its testnet already released and a secure, patient-managed Health Database.","Blockchain and Cryptocurrency, Health Care, Other",3.0,11-50,"Dimitar Dimitrakiev, Jeremias Grenzebach, Philipp Grenzebach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

It provides advanced tools and services to be used by healthcare professionals. PostDICOM is an advanced software for all users who want secure data archiving and access in the healthcare field, especially healthcare professionals. With this software, both individuals and corporate users will be able to convert any medical image into DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format and store it in the cloud environment. Data is stored in the cloud and provided with high-level data security. It is easily accessible from any HTML5 compliant devices (desktop PCs, tablets and smartphones). Owing to these qualities, it can be used as an individual archive for many years as well as being used as a PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) and TeleHealth solution for a hospital chain. If you want to use it as a PACS solution, you will be able to access the data very quickly thanks to advanced image processing tools and data streaming algorithms. Under all conditions, our highest priority is that the end user gets the best service. The system is available with 50 GB of free space. This space is free and expandable. If you need more space, request for an additional data and we will provide you storage space with a fee. The software is mainly used for image archiving, processing and grouping, and in the future it will be used for sharing and training purposes. With these features, it goes beyond just being an archive and ensures that all users behave like an independent enterprise on the system. Healthcare professions will be able to exchange ideas with their colleagues on their own fields, offer their patients a second opinion and safely archive data from patients if necessary. Our company is well aware of the importance and confidentiality of healthcare data. We will take highest level of safety precautions and will not allow even the smallest system vulnerability. It is our greatest desire that our users use this service with great pleasure and enthusiasm. For this purpose, we express that we are open to any suggestions, opinions and requests that you may send us. Our only expectation from our users is that you can not allow the system to be used outside the intended purpose. It is important to notify us about any sharing and approach that will harm this structure. Since the sharing environment of the software will provide the safest transfer of any kind of medical information, it will also eliminate problems related to personality rights and patient privacy. Because the patient information can be anonymized and shared, patient identity will not be known except for the archiving user. Since there are no restrictions or technological limitations associated with accessing the system from mobile devices, it is possible to transfer and display data from any mobile device. Patient and doctor communications will be easy in the case of emergency.","Health Care, Information Technology, Software",,11-50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,

Before DepotCity the search for suitable warehouse space and fulfillment services was a timely, in transparent and manual task: desk research, phone calls and emails used to be the tools to purchase storage space. In addition, in-depth logistical knowledge was advantageous to compare and rate different service offerings. Additionally, minimum trading units and inflexible contract durations made short term usage of storage solutions nearly impossible.  DepotCity is an easy and comfortable solution to this problem. Through its website www.depotcity.de, after filling out basic information about the required service, an offer is made and can be booked instantly.

It's a SaaS platform that directs and governs scheduling processes for the benefit of a company’s business and productivity. Companies have numerous tools to manage data and processes. But they don't have any tool to manage and prioritise the organisation's time. When which group of participants works together on which topic is controlled exclusively by structural specifications. We are convinced that in a knowledge-driven economy, the use of time to create value must be digitised and automated. Therefor Scedule goes beyond the known scope of scheduling tools: A smart algorithm identifies meaningful date proposals that take into account specific business preferences. Resource bookings in linked groupware are made automatically and in advance according to the schedule. The Scedule API enables the integration of ready-to-use applications into company-specific collaboration tools.

That is why we have developed intelligent solutions under the nevisCura brand that significantly improve the living and working situation of people in the care sector. Our technical assistance systems have been specially developed for care facilities to offer them a cost-effective and efficient solution for more relief and security. In doing so, we have never lost sight of the customer focus and have incorporated the feedback from numerous pilot projects with long-standing customers into the further development. Only in this way could we be sure that our solutions supported caregivers in their everyday work and relieved them in the long term. And that for many years: because the solutions are designed to be future-proof so that you benefit from regular updates and the highest level of investment protection. Our solution consists of the nevisCura bed and room sensor. The bed sensor from nevisCura is an intelligent bed exit alarm that noticeably facilitates the daily work of caregivers. Once attached to the bed in just a few steps, the silent guard discreetly signals when a resident wants to get out of bed - even before he or she has set foot on the floor. And best of all: the sensor is compatible with every common call system. The room sensor from nevisCura is an innovative sensor system that is used for fall detection and prevention in outpatient and inpatient care facilities. Once installed all around at the height of the base boards, it offers the greatest protection for residents and noticeably relieves caregivers.","Hardware, Health Care, Internet Services, Software",4.0,11-50,"Christian Kind, David Link, Dennis Breuer, Stelios Katsanevakis",5.0,Early Stage Venture,2020-01-10,,,,Series A,,,,Series A,125000.0,EUR,135816.0,175000.0,EUR,194872.0,"EIT Health, Schürfeld Group, European Data Incubator",3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Private,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
